This folder contains files required to run the Mechanics-Informed Model-Free Symbolic Regression framework (the model-free separation part and polynimial/non-polynomial fitting part). Besides this work, users are required to build the dataset in the form of {X,Y} to solve Y=f(X). This work relies the mechanics-criterion to select the solution with better generalizability. The use of intermediate variable can significantly improve the performance as discussed in the paper. (Ref: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2024.105916)

FEA datasets for the SENB problem and for the CLEC problem are given in Case1.txt and Case2.txt respectively.
